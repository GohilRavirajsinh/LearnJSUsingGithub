How Does javascript Execute?

{} Globel Execution Context (this.)

-> Globel Execution Context     --First
-> Function Execution Context   --Second

Its run in Two Phase...
-> Memory Creation Phase
-> Execution Phase

Now Understand Using this Exa... ___________________________________

Step 1 -> Globel Execution
            |               
          this.  (Allocate First this.)

Step 2 -> Enter in Phases
        1st Memory Phase / Creation Phase
             # Store all the variables
            -> val1 => in variable (undefined)
            -> val2 => in variable (undefined)
            -> addnum => in function (defination)
            -> result1 => undefined
            -> result2 => undefined
        #Memory Creation Phase Completed
                    |^| 
This Cycle Execute All the time in First

Step 3 -> Process in Phases
        2nd Execution Phase
            -> val1 => 10
            -> val2 => 5     ______________
            -> addnum ====> | New Variable |<===== The More Time Function Executes, then the More Boxes Created!    
                            |  Environment |
                            |       +      |<-- BoxCalled New Execution Context Create/Process For (addnum Function)
                            |  Execution   |
                            |_____Thread___|Now, in box the Two Steps Run Again -> Memory Creation Phase
                                                                                -> Execution Phase
                            1st Memory Phase / Creation Phase
                                 # Store variables
                                -> val1 => undefined

                            2nd Execution Phase
                                -> num1 => 10
                                -> num2 => 5
                                -> total => 15 (Now the total is return to Globel Execution Context)
                            # After Completing the New Executional Context are Delete Automatically and then contineu..
            -> result1 => 15
            -> result2 => #Enter in Box Again and run Two Steps Again
                            1st Memory Phase
                                 # Store variables
                                -> val1 => undefined
                                -> val2 => undefined
                                -> total => undefined
                            2nd Execution Phase
                                -> num1 => 10
                                -> num2 => 2
                                -> total => 12 (Now Again Delete This Process Here) [result2 =>  12]
